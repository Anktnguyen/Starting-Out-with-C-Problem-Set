# Starting-Out-with-Python-Problem-Set

Welcome to my Starting Out with Python repository.

All codes were written in VSCode IDE.

This is my journey to learning and practicing coding in Python.

One day I will look back and laugh at how I wrote these lines of code, but for now, I feel happy that I started this journey.
